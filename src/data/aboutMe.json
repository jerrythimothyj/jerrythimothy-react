  "objective": "Looking for a challenging position in a reputed organization which will cater to the active utilization of my acquired skills, abilities and knowledge, thereby working towards the betterment of the organization and to grow as an individual.",
  "about": "My thought is that whoever you are, you should have the knowledge of your practical affairs. Action in this life is a must. Since action is called practice, persons who live on Earth have to be practical. This means that you cannot spend all day sitting down in a chair, passing the time imagining, worrying, and thinking, and in doing so, forgetting to use your body for performing those actions that need to be done. Many have concluded that when one does action, it is difficult, because to do action, a person has to get up from the bed and move about. Lying down is thought of rest. Moving about is thought of as difficult."
